/*
 m'kay. in order to get the correct ADTS headers for streaming
 we need to do some messed up shit.
 we could, of course, write a routine to do this, hell, GPT will knock you
 one out in seconds (theres one in here if you're interested in doing the
 comparison)
 
 Or ... we could also just use Apple's maintained (lol) and battle tested code.
 I'm generally in favour of doing that when we can, but as is often the case,
 we will have to bend things a little.
 
 It will not have escaped the attention of the curious reader that we can just spam
 our audio buffers to a file, and the file writer will add headers for us (don't
 forget your magic cookie if you do this!)
 
 So can we just use the file writer but like, not write? YES!
 
 We will set up an Audio File pipeline that works with callbacks using the
 AudioFileInitializeWithCallbacks API and then we will spam packets at it
 with AudioFileWritePackets and it will do the business for us.
 
 sort of.
